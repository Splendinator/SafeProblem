dial.cpp  (override +/-  to turn clockwise/counterclockwise)
lock.cpp - array of dials   (override [] to index into dials) 
safe.cpp - array of locks   (override [] to index into locks)

Make sure to use statics where applicable to keep data contiguous   (array of safes should be contiguous chars in memory for each dial if possible)

Hashing algorithms can be done parallel since they can be added to each other.  (Matrix.cpp maybe to calculate all 3 hash numbers quickly (multithreading?))

override ostream to easily output safe (and lock (and dial))

maybe override istream?
